## Selected Research Projects

### Commercial Property Price Indices for France

Construction of the first public transaction-based commercial real estate indices for France using millions of DV3F property transactions and hedonic modelling. The project sheds light on price dynamics, non-prime segments, and financial stability implications.

### International Digital Twin for Climate Shocks

Development of a multi-country Digital Twin integrating physical hazard maps, firm-level financial statements, and real-estate exposures to quantify damages and solvency effects for firms and banks. Used to support macroprudential climate-risk analysis.

### Land-Use & Land-Take Accounts (2008–2021)

Creation of annual land-use and land-take accounts for all French sectors and firms using geospatial datasets (Fichiers Fonciers, SIRENE). The work documents sectoral footprints and helps design “no net land-take” policies.

### Biodiversity-Related Transition Risk Assessment

Quantification of sectoral exposure to biodiversity-related constraints via land-use dependencies, linking ecological pressures to sectoral vulnerabilities and transition risks.
