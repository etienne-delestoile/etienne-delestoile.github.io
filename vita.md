# Bio

Étienne de L’Estoile is an economist in the **Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability Division** at the Banque de France.  
His work sits at the intersection of **climate risks, macroeconomics, real estate markets, and financial stability**, combining granular data with empirical and geospatial modelling.

He holds a **PhD in Economics from Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne**, where his dissertation examined:

- the construction of commercial real estate price indices for France,  
- the transmission of physical climate risks through firms’ balance sheets,  
- the role of land use and land take in shaping sectoral vulnerabilities,  
- and the implications of environmental shocks for macro-financial stability.

Before joining the Banque de France, he contributed to academic, policy, and editorial projects, and served as **President of the editorial committee of *Regards croisés sur l’économie***.

His research and outreach activities aim to make complex questions—climate-related financial risks, land-use transitions, systemic vulnerabilities—more accessible to policymakers, institutions, and the wider public.
