**Climate & Macroeconomics Economist**  
Macroprudential Policy • Climate Risk • Financial Stability • Real Estate

📍 Paris, France · ✉️ [etiennedelestoile@gmail.com](mailto:etiennedelestoile@gmail.com)

I am an Economist in the Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability Division at the Banque de France and hold a PhD in Economics from Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.  
My work focuses on the intersection of **climate risks, macro-financial stability, and data-intensive modelling**.

I develop empirical tools to quantify the exposure of firms, banks, and economic systems to environmental shocks, using high-resolution physical risk data, geospatial information, and granular balance-sheet microdata. My research is applied, policy-relevant, and aims to inform central banks, regulators, and institutions about emerging climate vulnerabilities.
