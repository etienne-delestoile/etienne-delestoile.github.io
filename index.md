## About Me

I am an Economist in the Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability Division at the Banque de France and hold a PhD in Economics from Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.  
My work focuses on the intersection of **climate risks, macro-financial stability, and data-intensive modelling**.

I develop empirical tools to quantify the exposure of firms, banks, and economic systems to environmental shocks, using high-resolution physical risk data, geospatial information, and granular balance-sheet microdata. My research is applied, policy-relevant, and aims to inform central banks, regulators, and institutions about emerging climate vulnerabilities.

## Selected Research Projects

### Commercial Property Price Indices for France

Construction of the first public transaction-based commercial real estate indices for France using millions of DV3F property transactions and hedonic modelling. The project sheds light on price dynamics, non-prime segments, and financial stability implications.

### International Digital Twin for Climate Shocks

Development of a multi-country Digital Twin integrating physical hazard maps, firm-level financial statements, and real-estate exposures to quantify damages and solvency effects for firms and banks. Used to support macroprudential climate-risk analysis.

### Land-Use & Land-Take Accounts (2008–2021)

Creation of annual land-use and land-take accounts for all French sectors and firms using geospatial datasets (Fichiers Fonciers, SIRENE). The work documents sectoral footprints and helps design “no net land-take” policies.

### Biodiversity-Related Transition Risk Assessment

Quantification of sectoral exposure to biodiversity-related constraints via land-use dependencies, linking ecological pressures to sectoral vulnerabilities and transition risks.

## Policy & Institutional Work

At the Banque de France, I contribute to the design of macroprudential tools and climate-risk frameworks. My work feeds into:

- Macroprudential policy discussions  
- NGFS-related working groups  
- FSB and international financial-stability exchanges  

I build modelling frameworks to support policy analysis and regulatory decisions.

## Outreach & Dissemination

I am committed to making research accessible:

- Blog and outreach articles on climate economics and financial stability  
- Participation in roundtables and public discussions  
- Explanatory videos and educational content  
- President of *Regards Croisés sur l'Économie*, a journal dedicated to research dissemination, where I coordinated a multidisciplinary editorial team
