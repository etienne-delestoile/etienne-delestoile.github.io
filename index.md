# About Me

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      I am an Economist in the Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability Division at the Banque de France and hold a PhD in Economics from Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.
      My work focuses on the intersection of <strong>climate risks, macro-financial stability, and data-intensive modelling</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I develop empirical tools to quantify the exposure of firms, banks, and economic systems to environmental shocks, using high-resolution physical risk data, geospatial information, and granular balance-sheet microdata. My research is applied, policy-relevant, and aims to inform central banks, regulators, and institutions about emerging climate vulnerabilities.
